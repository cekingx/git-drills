## Learning Path

### 1. Basic Level (12 challenges)

Master fundamental rebasing concepts:

- **Interactive Rebase** (3 challenges): Learn `git rebase -i` basics
- **Squash Commits** (3 challenges): Combine related commits
- **Reorder Commits** (2 challenges): Arrange commits logically
- **Edit Messages** (2 challenges): Improve commit message quality
- **Split Commits** (2 challenges): Break large commits into focused units

### 2. Intermediate Level (10 challenges)

Handle more complex scenarios:

- **Rebase Conflicts** (3 challenges): Resolve conflicts during rebase
- **Branch Cleanup** (3 challenges): Clean up messy branch histories
- **History Rewriting** (2 challenges): Safely rewrite commit history
- **Reflog Recovery** (2 challenges): Recover from rebase mistakes

### 3. Advanced Level (8 challenges)

Master expert-level operations:

- **Complex Rebases** (2 challenges): Multi-branch rebase scenarios
- **Git Archaeology** (2 challenges): Investigate using Git history
- **Workflow Optimization** (2 challenges): Maximize Git efficiency
- **Advanced Recovery** (2 challenges): Handle complex Git disasters

### 4. Workflow Integration (6 challenges)

Apply skills in real-world contexts:

- **Feature Branch Flow** (2 challenges): Integrate rebasing into development
- **Open Source Contribution** (2 challenges): Prepare PR-ready commits
- **Team Collaboration** (2 challenges): Balance rebasing with team workflows

## Examples

### Example 1: Clean Up Feature Branch

```bash
# Run interactive rebase challenge
./git-drill.sh --level basic --concept interactive_rebase --problem 1

# The challenge creates a messy commit history
# Your goal: use git rebase -i to clean it up
# Expected: 3 clean, logical commits with conventional messages
```

### Example 2: Squash WIP Commits

```bash
# Run squash commits challenge
./git-drill.sh --level basic --concept squash_commits --problem 1

# The challenge creates multiple WIP commits
# Your goal: squash them into atomic commits
# Expected: logical grouping of related changes
```

### Example 3: Take Knowledge Quiz

```bash
# Test your understanding
./git-drill.sh --quiz --concept interactive_rebase

# Answer multiple choice questions
# Get explanations for correct answers
# Earn badges for high scores
```

## Challenge Structure

Each challenge includes:

- **setup.sh**: Creates realistic Git scenario
- **problem.md**: Detailed problem description and goals
- **verify.sh**: Automated solution verification

### Success Criteria

- Correct commit count and structure
- Proper commit message format
- Maintained functionality
- Clean, linear history
- Efficiency targets met

## Efficiency Metrics

Git Drills tracks your performance:

- **Command Count**: How many Git commands you use
- **Time Taken**: How long to complete challenges
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of tests passed
- **Improvement**: Progress over time

### Target Metrics by Level

- **Basic**: â‰¤5 commands, â‰¤3 minutes
- **Intermediate**: â‰¤8 commands, â‰¤5 minutes  
- **Advanced**: â‰¤12 commands, â‰¤10 minutes
- **Workflows**: â‰¤15 commands, â‰¤15 minutes

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable/disable features
export ENABLE_CLAUDE_INTEGRATION=true
export ENABLE_EFFICIENCY_TRACKING=true
export ENABLE_AUTO_HINTS=true

# Set logging level
export LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Configure safety settings
export AUTO_BACKUP=true
export SAFE_MODE_DEFAULT=false
```

### Git Configuration

Git Drills automatically sets up Git configuration for challenges:

```bash
git config user.name "Git Drills Student"
git config user.email "student@git-drills.local"
```

## Tips for Success

### General Strategy

1. **Read the Problem**: Understand the scenario and goals
2. **Analyze Current State**: Use `git log --oneline` to see history
3. **Plan Your Approach**: Decide which commits to squash/reorder
4. **Execute Carefully**: Use interactive rebase step by step
5. **Verify Results**: Check that all criteria are met

### Common Patterns

- **Squash debug commits** with their related feature commits
- **Reorder commits** for logical flow (setup â†’ implementation â†’ tests)
- **Use conventional commit messages** (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Keep atomic commits** (one logical change per commit)

### Interactive Rebase Commands

- `pick`: Keep commit as-is
- `reword`: Change commit message
- `edit`: Stop and modify commit
- `squash`: Combine with previous commit (edit message)
- `fixup`: Combine with previous commit (keep message)
- `drop`: Remove commit entirely

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Challenge won't start**:

- Check that you're in the correct directory
- Ensure setup.sh is executable
- Verify Git is installed and configured

**Verification fails**:

- Read error messages carefully
- Check commit count and messages
- Ensure working directory is clean
- Verify you're on the correct branch

**Rebase conflicts**:

- Read conflict markers carefully
- Edit files to resolve conflicts
- Use `git add` to stage resolved files
- Continue with `git rebase --continue`

### Recovery Commands

```bash
# Abort current rebase
git rebase --abort

# View reflog to see previous states
git reflog

# Reset to previous state
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}

# Create backup branch
git branch backup-branch
```
